"Backup-Settings"
This copies all your existing settings into a safe area ready to restore if you want to.
These only get overwritten if you choose this option again.

"Restore-Backup"
This will used the files that were backed up, and copy them back for you.

"Default"
This resets your files to the stock install of RetroPie 3 beta 2.

"Install Required Files"
This copies the extra overlays and shaders etc.. across to the correct directories on your Pi. You only need to run this once per version of the Video Manager. It doesnt do any harm if you run it more than once.


"Use Shaders"
This will apply a shader file to the systems, as opposed to using overlays at all.

"CRT Shader"

There are some variables set at the top of the shaders/crt-pi.glsl file that can be used to control some aspects of the shader.

#define MULTISAMPLE
#define CURVATURE
#define BARREL_DISTORTION_X 0.15
#define BARREL_DISTORTION_Y 0.25
#define MASK_BRIGHTNESS 0.65
#define SCAN_LINE_WEIGHT 6.0
#define BLOOM_FACTOR 1.5
#define INPUT_GAMMA 2.4
#define OUTPUT_GAMMA 2.2

You can change the curvature by changing the BARREL_DISTORTION_X and BARREL_DISTORTION_Y values (0.0 will turn it off for that dimension). Better, you can turn if off entirely by commenting out the CURVATURE line (put a double slash // at the start of the line). This will cause it to skip the distortion code and speeds up the shader a bit. The barrel and mask shaders can be similarly controlled but just have the BARREL_DISTORTION_X and BARREL_DISTORTION_Y values.

You can similarly comment out the MULTISAMPLE line and speed things up a bit by skipping the multi-sample code at the risk of increasing moire effects.

MASK_BRIGHTNESS controls how bright the screen will be.

You’re best leaving the others alone. Altering SCAN_LINE_WEIGHT and BLOOM_FACTOR will likely make moire effects worse. The two GAMMA values affect brightness and should not need changing on a correctly configured monitor (and if you monitor is not correctly configured, fixing that is a far better idea).

It’s perhaps worth pointing out that the shader is designed to be used with linear filtering. CRT electron beams are not square and the combination of linear filtering with scan lines and bloom makes the edges of bright pixels next to dark pixels rounded which looks a bit more accurate. People are of course free to set filtering to nearest if they prefer.

"Overlays"
These are the settings from user "patl" found here:

"Overlays-no-smooth"
These are the settings from user "patl" found here:

The only difference here is that smoothing has been turned off.

"Overlays-No-TV"
These are the settings from user "patl" found here:

There is no TV border showing on the overlay here.

patrickm has said "I think 5x is preferable for most systems that displayed on a CRT TV such as NES, SNES, and Genesis because it doesn’t show any of the overscan that was cropped on a real CRT and it doesn’t result in any letterboxing of the image, which takes full advantage of the screen/TV’s display area."


"Consoles-1080p"
These are the settings from user "patrickm" found here:
http://blog.petrockblock.com/forums/topic/list-of-recommended-shaders-for-raspberry-piretropie-how-to-get-the-crt-look/

patrickm has said "some people might prefer 4x because the scanlines are slightly bolder/thicker at that scale, and some people like bolder scanlines. Or, someone might simply want to see every line put out by the console, even if it wasn’t meant to be displayed."

"Thorig-1080p"
These settings are using new custom overlays that have a different TV overlay used.

"Chito-1080p"

These are designed for a 720p screen

"Quit"
This will exit the tool, making no changes.


You can package up your setting like this (This will help others debug your problems or share your settings for others to check out)

Type this command when in a SSH session:
zip -r /opt/retropie/configs/all/config-details.zip /opt/retropie/configs/*

That will create the config-details.zip file in the directory shown above, this can either be uploaded to the forum or somewhere like http://www.tinyupload.com/
You can either FTP the file from the Pi to your PC, or use the samba share, as it should be auto shared, so you just browse to the directory above via windows networking.
